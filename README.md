*Song guessing game with Spotify*

The other day, I stumbled across some code I wrote years ago for a shell based game called "Song Guesser". After realising how fun it was, I decided to try and get AI to turn it into a web-based game. This repository is what it came up with.

The original code is in [app.py](/app.py) (no AI used there!)

Play the game at [tunify.hamster45105.dev](tunify.hamster45105.dev). All you need is a Spotify account, everything is pretty self explanatory!
